# Custom PHP MVC Framework

This was my first attempt to understand the MVC architecture in PHP language. I did not know how to use Laravel back then, but this fundamental framework which I have written with the help of internet and youtube opened my eyes and showed how MVC works from the very bottom.

## Features

- Custom MVC Framework
- Logic of connecting models and views via controllers
- Login and generic auth actions
- Examples of custom MySql queries
- Demonstration of ussage of vanilla PHP

## Important Note
This was my very first project and does not represent my current skills in backend and frontend development. However I feel that it is very important to show my learning path via this repository.
